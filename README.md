## conways-game-of-life

This program will simulate Conways Game of Life.
Note: Currently this only simulates one generation given a specific state. More will be added.

#### How to use it:

1. Make a text file with the initial area you want. Ideally seperate each tile with a space.
   Eg:
<pre>
   0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1  
   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1  
   0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0  
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
   0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0  
   0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0  
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0  
</pre>
2. In the terminal, run the program with your text file as the argument.
3. It will display the area you typed, and then show the next area.
