## conways-game-of-life

This program will simulate Conways Game of Life.
Note: Currently this only simulates one generation given a specific state. More will be added.

#### How to use it:

1. Make a text file with the initial area you want. Ideally seperate each tile with a space
   Eg: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
       1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
       0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
       0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
2. In the terminal, run the program with your text file as the first argument, and the name of the output file as the second argument.
